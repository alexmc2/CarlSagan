        <strong>Carl Sagan was an American astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, and science communicator. He was best known as a pioneer in the field of exobiology, which is the study of the possibility of extraterrestrial life. His TV series <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i> has been described as "a watershed moment for science-themed television programming"and has been credited with inspiring a generation of scientists and sparking a renewed interest in the exploration of space.</strong>

      <h3 id="headline"><strong>Here is the story of Carl Sagan's Life:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Born in Brooklyn in 1934 to parents, Rachel, a housewife, and Samuel, an immigrant garment worker from the former Russian Empire. </li>
        <li>
          Of his parents, Sagan said: "My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method."
        </li>
        <li>
          Sagan was a gifted student and at the age of 16, he enrolled at the University of Chicago where he studied physics.
        </li>
        <li>
          After earning his doctorate Sagan began teaching at Harvard, and as a young scientist, he earned notice for research indicating that Venus endured a greenhouse effect that roasted the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sagan became a full professor at Cornell in 1970 and directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there. From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part PBS television series <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i>, which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television at the time. The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 countries.The book, <i>Cosmos</i>, written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal Science, signed by 70 scientists, including seven Nobel Prize winners. This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field.
        </li>
        <li>
          After Cosmos aired, Sagan became associated with the catchphrase "billions and billions," although he never actually used the phrase in the Cosmos series. He rather used the term "billions upon billions."
        </li>
        <li>
          Sagan perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect. He testified to the US Congress in 1985 that the greenhouse effect would change the earth's climate system.
          </l>
        <li>
          In 1984 he co-authored the book <i>The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War</i> and in 1990 the book <i>A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race</i>, which explains the nuclear-winter hypothesis and advocates nuclear disarmament.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1994 he was a recipient of the Public Welfare Medal, the highest award of the National Academy of Sciences for "distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare".
        </li>
        <li>
          As a humorous tribute to Sagan and his association with the catchphrase "billions and billions", a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number – technically at least four billion (two billion plus two billion) – of anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sagan became gravely sick with the blood disorder myelodysplasia in 1994, and underwent a bone marrow transplant from his sister, Cari. Sagan died at the age of 62 on December 20, 1996.
